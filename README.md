# Azeroth_Narrator
A TTS narrator for WoW

Just a proof of concept I am releasing, feel free to fork or whatever

I do not know if this breaks TOS, I accept no responsibity for bans.



Simply goto: Azeroth_Narrator/warcraft_narrator/warcraft_narrator/bin/Debug/

then go into the Addon folder, install "Azeroth_Narrator" into your addon dir

Then run warcraft_narrator.exe and start the game, the application will read the quest text for you using your systems default voice.
